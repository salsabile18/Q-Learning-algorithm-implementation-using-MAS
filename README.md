## Multi-Agent Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation (Java)
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Q-learning algorithm using a multi-agent system. The Q-learning algorithm is a popular reinforcement learning technique used to solve Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this implementation, multiple agents interact with an environment and learn optimal policies through an iterative process.

## Getting Started
To get started with this implementation, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE of your choice.
Open the project by selecting the root directory of the cloned repository.
Configure the environment, agent parameters, and training settings in the provided classes.
Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
Usage
To use this implementation, you can follow the steps below:

## Configure the environment:

Define the state and action space for the agents.
Specify the reward structure and transition dynamics.
Implement any additional methods required for the environment.
Implement the Q-learning agent:

Create a class for the Q-learning agent(s).
Implement the necessary methods for Q-table manipulation, action selection, and learning.
Customize the exploration-exploitation trade-off strategy.
Set up the multi-agent system:

Create a class to manage the multi-agent system.
Initialize the agents, environment, and necessary variables.
Implement the main training loop for the multi-agent Q-learning algorithm.
Run the program:

Start the training process by running the main method or executing the designated entry point.
Monitor the training progress:

Observe the output and logging statements to track the training progress and performance metrics.
Visualize the learning curves or other relevant visualizations if implemented.
## Dependencies
This implementation has the following dependencies:
-Jade
-Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
